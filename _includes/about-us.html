    <h1 >About</h1>
    <p>This year, we have decided to host a hackathon in honour 
        of the English Mathematician Ada Lovelace, <b>AdaHack</b>. 
        The hackathon aims to celebrate our communityâ€™s creativity 
        and ideas and is a great opportunity for students from 
        different backgrounds to work together in teams and come 
        up with innovative solutions to real-world problems.
        It is a <u>48 hour virtual hackathon</u> in collaboration with 
        Major League Hacking open to gender minorities across Scotland. 
        The main medium of communication and announcements during the hackathon will be Discord. 
        Students can form teams of up to 4 people to submit their projects via Devpost. 
        There are a lot of exciting challenges and prizes for students of all programming 
        capabilities. <br><br>
        The <a href="https://edinburghhoppers.com" target="_blank">Edinburgh Hoppers</a> is the official society for gender 
        minorities in the School of Informatics at the University of
         Edinburgh. The objective of the society is to provide a 
         safe space for students of gender minorities to network and 
         enhance their skills.
