    <h1 >About</h1>
    <p>This year, we have decided to host a hackathon in honour 
        of the English Mathematician Ada Lovelace, <b>AdaHack</b>. 
        The hackathon aims to celebrate our communityâ€™s creativity 
        and ideas and is a great opportunity for students from 
        different backgrounds to work together in teams and come 
        up with innovative solutions to real-world problems.
        It is a <u>12 hour hackathon</u> in collaboration with 
        Major League Hacking open to all gender minorities. 
        The main medium of communication and announcements during the hackathon will be Discord.  
        There are a lot of exciting challenges and prizes for students of all programming 
        capabilities. <br><br>
        The <a href="https://edinburghhoppers.com" target="_blank">Edinburgh Hoppers</a> is the official society for gender 
        minorities in the School of Informatics at the University of
         Edinburgh. The objective of the society is to provide a 
         safe space for students of gender minorities to network and 
         enhance their skills. <br><br>
        <b>Note-</b> Everyone attending the hackathon is highly recommended to take a Lateral Flow Test in advance to ensure everyone's safety and
