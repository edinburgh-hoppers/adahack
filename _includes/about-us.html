    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>For the third year in a row, we are hosting the hackathon in honour of the English Mathematician Ada Lovelace,
        <b>AdaHack</b>. The hackathon aims to celebrate our community's creativity and ideas and is a great opportunity for students
        from different backgrounds to work together in teams and come up with innovative solutions to real-world problems.
        It is a 12 hour hackathon in collaboration with Major League Hacking, open to all gender minorities.
        There will be a lot of exciting challenges and prizes for students of all levels of programming capabilities.

        gender minorities in the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh. The objective of the society is to
        provide a safe space for students of gender minorities to network and enhance their skills.
